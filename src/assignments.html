            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            <p>
                There will be three assignments for this course. Each assignment will be worth 10% of your final grade for a total of 30%. Assignments are done with partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assignments are to be submitted on <a href="https://markus.utsc.utoronto.ca/cscb20w18" target="_blank">MarkUs</a> as described in each assignment's individual handout. Improperly submitted assignments may not be graded. All assignments must be able to compile and execute on UTSC lab machines. All assignments must be submitted before 11:59 PM on their given due date. A silent policy is enacted 12 hours before this time, during which no questions about the assignment will be answered by any TA or course instructor.
            </p>
